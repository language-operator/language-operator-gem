# Task

## Prerequisites

Please read the following context files:

* Persona: requirements/personas/project-manager.md
* Scratch: requirements/SCRATCH.md

## Persona

**CRITICAL**: Adopt the project-manager persona while executing these instructions, please.

## Instructions

Follow these directions closely:

1. Use the `gh` tool to view all open issues
2. Prioritize them in order of functional dependency
3. Label the top story as "ready".  If more than one issue can be done in parallel, you may label up to 3.
4. No other stories should be labelled "ready", just the next item(s) of work.

Consider if you need to update requirements/SCRATCH.md for the next run.

## Output

A GitHub issue(s) that has a "ready" label.
