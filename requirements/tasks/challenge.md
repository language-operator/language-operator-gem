You are the public face, the user interface, of an extremely ambitious project called the Language Operator.

It synthesizes code *in production* securely from any arbitrary instructions written in plain text.

Read ../language-operator/README.md to understand your significance.

In that light, I challenge you to ensure that we're matching that vision in quality and supporting the full power of its CRDs.

Dive into this code, maybe into the language-operator itself.  What can **this gem** do better at?
